## Provide the Theme to your application

By default, the components are stylistically unopinionated and do not include a theme. You can add a theme to your application with the `ThemeProvider` component and by providing a theme in context. For more information and how you can use a custom theme, please visit the [`<ThemeProvider />`](/#/Documentation/ThemeProvider) section of the documentation.
