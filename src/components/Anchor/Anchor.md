### Renders an HTML Anchor element with custom styling.
The `Anchor` component allows you to show links on the page, open them in a new window, and change the color. You can also use all the props available to the `Paragraph` component here too!

```jsx
import { Anchor } from '@moneypensionservice/directories';

<Anchor 
  href="https://www.google.co.uk"
  target="_blank"
>
  I'm a link to Google!
</Anchor>
```
